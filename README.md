Welcome to the **Comparison of Hybrid Rendering Techniques** repository! This project serves as a research monorepo for a master's thesis focused on evaluating rendering performance in React applications. The goal is to explore various rendering techniques, including Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and React Server Components (RSC).

## Introduction

Rendering performance is crucial for user experience in web applications. This repository investigates different rendering techniques used in React to determine their efficiency and effectiveness. By comparing CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR, and RSC, we aim to provide insights that can help developers choose the right rendering method for their projects.

## Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research include:

- Analyzing the performance metrics of various rendering techniques.
- Understanding the trade-offs between different methods.
- Providing recommendations for developers based on empirical data.

## Rendering Techniques Overview

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

In CSR, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and uses JavaScript to render content. This approach offers a dynamic user experience but can lead to slower initial load times.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SSR generates HTML on the server for each request. This method improves initial load time and SEO but can increase server load and complexity.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

SSG pre-renders pages at build time. This technique results in fast load times and excellent SEO but lacks dynamic content updates.

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

ISR allows static pages to be updated incrementally. This combines the benefits of SSG with the ability to serve fresh content without a full rebuild.

### React Server Components (RSC)

RSC enables developers to build components that can render on the server. This technique aims to improve performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.

## Performance Testing

To assess the performance of each rendering technique, we employed various testing strategies, including:

- **Load Time Measurement**: Using tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest to capture load times.
- **User Interaction Timing**: Analyzing how quickly users can interact with the application.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitoring CPU and memory usage during rendering.

The results of these tests are documented in the repository and provide a comprehensive view of each technique's strengths and weaknesses.

## Setup Instructions

To set up this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lesbicacomingsoon/comparison-of-hybrid-rendering-techniques.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
